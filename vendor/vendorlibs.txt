Libraries used inside Irrlicht and distributed with it.
There are sometimes a few files removed (large files we don't need and build files we don't use).
Inside Irrlicht the libs can have further changes, so when updating do a diff first between vendor libs and the corresponding libs in trunk.

-----
bzip2 
-----
version 1.0.6 from package bzip2-10.0.6.tar.gz
rm sample*
rm manual.*

Inside Irrlicht:
compress.c got renamed to bzcompress.c (no idea why...)
Also a few minor changes in bzlib.c and bzlib.h (probably to get it compiling on VS)

There is no vendorlib for lzma, not sure if that is accidental or not done because it's just one .c file and two headers.

gladman
-------
TODO - figure it out

-------
jpeglib
-------
version 9a from package jpegsrc.v9a.tar.gz
Has 2 additional files readme.dos and jdosaobj.txt which are only found in jpegsr9a.zip, but that is otherwise more different than the .tar.gz (maybe just around from an older version)

Inside Irrlicht:
Additional file jconfig.h (maybe generated somehow, seems to be a autoconfiguration header)

------
libpng
------
version 1.6.10 from package lpng1610.zip or pgng1610.7z (the xz or tar.gz downloads are more different)
Has some file contrib/tools/fixitxt.c added. My guess is that it's maybe from an older version. It's not used in Irrlicht.

Inside Irrlicht:
Additional file pnglibconf.h (seems to be autogenerated, using somehow scripts/pnglibconf.dfa)

----
zlib
----
version 1.2.8
rm -R -- */
rm *.com

Inside Irrlicht:
unchanged :-)

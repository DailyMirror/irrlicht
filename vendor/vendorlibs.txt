Libraries used inside Irrlicht and distributed with it.
There are sometimes a few files removed (large files we don't need and build files we don't use).
Inside Irrlicht the libs can have further changes, so when updating do a diff first between vendor libs and the corresponding libs in trunk.

-----
bzip2 
-----
version 1.0.6 from package bzip2-10.0.6.tar.gz
rm sample*
rm manual.*

Inside Irrlicht:
compress.c got renamed to bzcompress.c (no idea why...)
Also a few minor changes in bzlib.c and bzlib.h (probably to get it compiling on VS)

There is no vendorlib for lzma, not sure if that is accidental or not done because it's just one .c file and two headers.

-------
gladman
-------
enfile.zip from Gladman's site (http://173.254.28.24/~brgladma//oldsite/cryptography_technology/fileencrypt/index.php), removed the bzip stuff and renamed c files to cpp.
Note there is a newer version of most files on https://github.com/BrianGladman/AES. Including a newer license (similar to old but shorter).
But in Irrlicht we only care about unzipping password protected files, as long as that works and it compiles we are fine.

# remove files we don't need
rm *.vcproj
rm encfile.*
rm bzlib.h
rm -rf bzip2
rm main.c
# Rename c files to cpp (because we will use Irrlicht types later on)
for f in *.c; do mv -- "$f" "${f%.c}.cpp"; done

Inside Irrlicht:
There are a lot of minor changes. Most to get it compiling together with Irrlicht on all kind of platforms.

-------
jpeglib
-------
version 9a from package jpegsrc.v9a.tar.gz
Has 2 additional files readme.dos and jdosaobj.txt which are only found in jpegsr9a.zip, but that is otherwise more different than the .tar.gz (maybe just around from an older version)

Inside Irrlicht:
Additional file jconfig.h (maybe generated somehow, seems to be a autoconfiguration header)

------
libpng
------
version 1.6.10 from package lpng1610.zip or pgng1610.7z (the xz or tar.gz archives are different they support configure)
Has some file contrib/tools/fixitxt.c added. My guess is that it's maybe from an older version. It's not used in Irrlicht.

Inside Irrlicht:
Additional file pnglibconf.h autogenerated when calling make (in libpng, not in Irrlicht). 
Either get one of the Makefiles working to generate it or download an xz or tar.gz which supports configure and run that to get a Makefile.
Probably good idea to compare it with old pnglibconf.h when updating. Then just copy it over. Settings are not so platform specific that there seem to be problems.

Note: projects, scripts and contrib subfolders should all be removed inside source/Irrlicht/libpng.

----
zlib
----
version 1.2.8
rm -R -- */
rm *.com

Inside Irrlicht:
unchanged :-)
